        <p>
          I'm an atmospheric scientist and budding scientific software developer
          with over 8 years of experience turning complex weather data into
          clear, actionable insights. I have specialized in forecast
          verification, numerical weather prediction, and automating scientific
          workflows using Python and high-performance computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passionate about collaboration and clean code, I thrive at the
          intersection of research and software, helping teams accelerate
          weather modeling projects and make data-driven decisions. Currently,
          I‚Äôm learning front-end development and exploring new software
          development skills to keep growing and expanding my toolkit.
