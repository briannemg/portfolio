# 🌐 Brianne's Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site — built with React — where you can see what I’ve built, what I’m learning, and what I’m passionate about (spoiler: it's code and coffee ☕).

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository hosts the code for my developer portfolio website. The site serves as:

- A live showcase of my **projects**, skills, and technologies I’ve worked with.
- A downloadable copy of my **resume**.
- A way for others (recruiters, collaborators, fellow devs) to **get in touch** via email, GitHub, or LinkedIn.
- A hands-on space where I continue practicing **React, component-based design, and frontend architecture**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** – frontend framework
- **CSS** – custom styles
- **Vite** – lightning-fast build tool
- **React Icons** – for snazzy visual flair
- **GitHub Pages** – for deployment

## 🧩 Features

- Responsive design (yes, it looks good on your phone _and_ your 32” ultrawide)
- Project cards with links to live demos and GitHub repos
- Resume section with PDF download
